## A website built for a local pet grooming business.

## Tech Used: HTML, CSS
This site still needs optimization for mobile devices. As I continue to make improvements, I'll be focusing on converting the images to appropriate sizes and webp formats first.

## Lessons Learned:
I got a lot of practice in with setting background images on this site, and I was able to code in a new layout for The Team page using floats. This was also my first experience working with fontawesome as svg files. I played around a little with trying to update the fontawesome version that was already incorporated into the site, but ultimately was not able to figure out how. This is something I'd like to come back to in the future. Most recently, I also learned about the overflow property and that it will create scrollbars on elements when it's set to auto.
